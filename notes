 - questions raised by max (@notplants) as he contributes
   - rtc
     - why is a real-time clock needed? what does it do?
     - is there a recommened seller?
     - i see multiple variants of the module, which one should i get?
     + hobbytronics have discontinued the ds1338. the ds3231 looks like a solid alternative
       - requires slight change in configuration (/boot/firmware/config.txt : dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds3231)
