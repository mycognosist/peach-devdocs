# Introduction

PeachCloud is a low-power, lightweight hardware device designed to facilitate peer-to-peer communication across social networks. We aim to return (cloud) computing back into our homes and local communities in a way which fosters increased trust in one another and the socio-technical systems we inhabit.

This guide is intended to comprehensively document the PeachCloud project. It includes information about the hardware and software which comprises the device, as well as insight into the goals and design principles the project has grown from.
