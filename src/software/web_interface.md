# Web Interface

[peach-web](https://github.com/peachcloud/peach-web) provides a web interface for monitoring and interacting with the PeachCloud device. This allows administration of the single-board computer (ie. Raspberry Pi) running PeachCloud, as well as the ssb-server and related plugins.

**Stack**

The peach-web stack currently consists of [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) (Rust web framework), [Tera](https://tera.netlify.com/docs/installation/) (Rust template engine inspired by Jinja2 and the Django template language) and [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) (functional CSS library for humans).
